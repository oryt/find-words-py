# find-words-py
I did this script for a python course I was taking. Its a A python script that takes file name and a search word as argument and then the script will locate the word and then print out the line where the word is found together with line number and location  of the word on the line. I am certain that there is ways that this code could have been more slick but it served its purpose.
